Users will always have the freedom to move their social identity between applications, and developers will always have the freedom to build applications with new features on the network.\r\n\r\nOn Farcaster, you can broadcast short text messages and connect your Ethereum address. Verifying ownership of an address enables features like showcasing your NFT‚Äôs and using an NFT as a verified profile picture. Farcaster is a skin-in-the-game social network that‚Äôs not just about what you say but also about what you can prove on-chain.\r\n\r\nAnyone can build a client application to broadcast messages on the Farcaster network. We have a tutorial that will show you how to build a simple app to read messages from any user.
